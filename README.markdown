mk-project.el: An Emacs project library
=======================================

This is a personal fork of mk-project on which I chose to base my own experiments
regarding emacs project management on.

My aim is to add optionally loadable modules to mk-project that keep its core intact and
which enhance and further integrate mk-project into the packages that make up my own personal
emacs ecosystem.

Transitioning from a vanilla mk-project installation to my experimental branch should
be straightforward, but so far this is more or less untested.
